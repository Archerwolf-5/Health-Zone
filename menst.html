        <p>The menstrual cycle is a series of changes that occur in a woman's body as part of the preparation for the possibility of pregnancy occurring. It is a cycle that usually begins between 12 and 15 years of age that continues up until menopause, which, on average, occurs at the age of 52. The menstrual cycle is typically counted from the first day of one period to the first day of the next. It is controlled by the rise and fall of hormones. The length of a woman's menstrual cycle varies. A regular menstrual cycle is considered to be a menstrual cycle where the longest and shortest cycles vary by less than 8 days. The average menstrual cycle lasts 28 days.<br><br>
        A period, a commonly used term for referring to menstruation, is a woman's regular discharge of blood and mucosal tissue that occurs as part of the menstrual cycle. Bleeding and discharge of the mucosal lining of the uterus, through the vagina, usually lasts between 2 and 7 days. It occurs in the early phases of the menstrual cycle, referred to as the menstrual phase, which begins when the egg from a previous cycle is not fertilized. Periods stop during pregnancy, and typically do not resume during the early stages of breastfeeding. Periods also eventually stop permanently during menopause, usually between the ages of 49 and 52, and can be defined as having no vaginal bleeding for a year.<br><br>
        The Period Calculator estimates period days and the most probable ovulation days in calendar form. Period days are the days during which bleeding and discharge occur. The most probable ovulation days are the days during which a woman is most likely to ovulate.
